If you work in Java, and you don't use a decompiler, you haven't lived.

Well, maybe that's a bit excessive. Still, I'm shocked by the number of developers that don't use a decompiler like <a href="http://www.kpdus.com/jad.html">Jad</a> combined with their IDE, like with <a href="http://jadclipse.sourceforge.net/">Jadclipse</a> and <a href="eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>.

In eclipse, you can download the Java api source code and attach it that so you can always look at the actual code - original comments and all.

However, you want to be able to look at the source code for any jars that your application depends on as well. I didn't even realize how useful and freeing it is to be able to do that until I started. I would say that less than 30% of all developers that I've met use a decompiler, but it's definitely one of the top plugins you have to have.
