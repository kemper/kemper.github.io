I upgraded Mac OS X to 10.5.8. I did the upgrade after my hard drive died and imported my profile from an old backup. When I tried to run my Cisco VPN client that I use for work, I was given this error:

Error 51: Unable to communicate with the VPN subsystem

First, I read that I could do this in the terminal:

<div style="background-color: black; color:white;">
$ sudo /System/Library/StartupItems/CiscoVPN/CiscoVPN restart
</div>

Since I don't have a CiscoVPN directory under startup items, that didn't help me. Then I read that you need to to repair disk permissions using disk utility. I did that and it found several inconsistencies. Good stuff, though, it also did not solve my problem.

Then, I read that I could do this:

<div style="background-color: black; color:white;">$ sudo SystemStarter restart CiscoVPN</div>

The command didn't produce any output, nor did it fix my problem.

Finally, I came across a site that told me to do this:

<div style="background-color: black; color:white;">
$ sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext <br />
$ sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext
</div>

This finally fixed my problem. Here is the sequence of commands that I ran and the output:

<div style="background-color: black; color:white;">
$ sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext
kextunload: unload kext /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext failed
$ sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext
kextload: /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext loaded successfully
$ sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext
kextunload: unload kext /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext succeeded
$ sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext
kextload: /System/Library/Extensions/CiscoVPN.kext loaded successfully
</div>

Hopefully, this will save someone some time.
